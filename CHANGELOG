	* Optimized caching in ODBCCachedResultSet.
	* Added support for manual row counting in ODBCResultSet. This is helpful
	  for ODBC drivers which don't return a valid count when odbc_num_rows()
	  is called after a query.

2004-11-04 13:51  revjim

	* [Jargon] Altered all referenced of CONSTANTS in Record to use proper 
	  namespaces (i.e. UPDATE becomes Record::UPDATE) in order to remove 
	  E_NOTICE errors and provide proper operation (as the default is to 
	  interpret the constant as a string).

2004-11-04 13:42  revjim

	* [Jargon] Altered all calls to "is_a" to use the new "instanceof"
