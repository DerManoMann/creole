  ==================================

  Creole is very simple to install.  We will assume that if you are reading this
  then you downloaded the full Creole package (rather than installed using the
  PEAR installer).
  
  To use Creole you simply need to copy the classes/creole/ and classes/jargon/
  directories to a location on your PHP include_path.
  
  For example, on my Linux system I might install Creole like this:
  
  $> tar zxvf creole-x.x.x.tar.gz
  $> cd creole
  $> mv classes/creole  /usr/local/lib/php/
  $> mv classes/jargon /usr/local/lib/php/
  
  Same principle applies to Windows, but of course on Windows it's probably easier
  to click .... drag .... drop.
    
  Alternatively you can edit your php.ini file to set your PHP include_path variable
  to include the /path/to/creole/classes directory.
  
  That's all!  -- see http://creole.phpdb.org for usage examples and other project 
  information.
