  ===========

  Creole is a database abstraction layer for PHP5. It abstracts PHP's native 
  db-specific API to create more portable code while also providing developers 
  with a clean fully object-oriented interface based loosely on the API for Java's 
  JDBC.
   
  There are a number of reasons why Creole exists (when there are already several
  options for PHP).  Please see http://creole.phpdb.org for documentation,
  propaganda, and links to the competition.

  ===========
  
  Jargon is part of the "Creole" project, but is considered a different package.
  The Jargon classes provide convenience features that Creole - which is designed
  to be a db abstraction layer for use within other apps and frameworks - lacks.
  
  Jargon provides convenience features such as the PEAR [M]DB getCol(), getOne(),
  etc. functions; Jargon makes it easy to perform paged queries; and Jargon
  provides a very basic set of DAO classes.  
  
  See the INSTALL document to learn how to install these libraries.  For more
  usage examples, please visit the site at http://creole.phpdb.org .
