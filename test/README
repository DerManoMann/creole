This directory is for running tests that test the behavior of Creole classes.  Some
of the unit tests can be performed without any database connection, but the majority
of the tests here are to test for correct behavior when using a database.

To use the unit scripts you must have PHPUnit2 >= 2.0.0 installed.  You can
install this package using the PEAR installer ("pear install PHPUnit2"), or you can
download it from http://pear.php.ent/package/PHPUnit2.

Use the run-tests.php script to run driver tests.  In order to do this you should
create an empty temporary database (or use an existing temp db or :memory: for
SQLite).  Invoke the run-tests.php script passing the DSN connection as a parameter
(if you don't you'll be asked for it later, anyway).  For example:

	$> php -f run-tests.php mysql://root@localhost/creoletests
